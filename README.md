# Cellular_Automata
This project simulate a cellular automata that moves randomly

You can chose different parameters, if you want to see the probabilistic distribution that the code generate,
you should put that the automata moves just to the front, and put the same numbre of iterations and dimension of the box.

Enojy it!
